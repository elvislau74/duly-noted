  ## Description

  In this project, we were challenged to build a progressive web application (PWA). What is a PWA you may ask? It is an app that is built using traditional web platform technologies, but can run on any platform smoothly. The benefits of a PWA is that they are smaller and enable faster loading than native web apps. And they can also easily be downloaded for local offline use on any device.

  ## Installation

  This application is deployed onto Heroku, so you do not need to install anything. Everything can be tested on the live site. 

  However, if you want to test the repository code directly, please follow these steps below:

  The user must have Node.js downloaded onto their system. It is recommended that the user downloads v16 up to v18 for this application to run properly. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v16.16.0).

  After downloading node, make sure to type these into the integrated terminal in the root directory of this project and run these following commands: 
  - `npm install` or `npm i` to install all the required dependencies in all the folders.
  - `npm run start` to run the current webpack build and start the server.
